## Filmoteka
Filmoteka is a two-page website designed to provide users with access to trending movies, search for movies based on keywords, view movie details, trailers, and create their own library of watched movies or movies to watch.

## Home Page
The home page features a search form where users can enter keywords to search for movies. When no search term is entered, a list of trending movies from the day is displayed in the form of cards. Clicking on a movie card opens a modal window where users can explore movie information and add the movie to their watched list or queue for future viewing. At the bottom of the page, pagination is available for easy navigation between movie lists.

## My Library Page
The "My Library" page is a user's personal library, which includes two sections: "Watched" and "Queue." These sections display movies as cards based on the user's previous actions. Clicking on a movie card allows users to view detailed information about the movie and remove it from their library.
